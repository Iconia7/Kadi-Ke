## 📜 Game Rules (Kadi)

### Objective
Be the first player to finish all your cards.

### Core Rules
- **Matching**  
  Play a card that matches the **Suit** or **Rank** of the top card.

- **Power Cards (Bombs)**  
  `2`, `3`, and `Joker` increase the picking penalty. They can be played at any time.

### Defending Against Bombs
- **Stack** – Play another bomb to pass the penalty forward  
- **King** – Return the penalty to the sender  
- **Jack** – Skip the next player  
- **Ace** – Block the bomb completely (resets penalty to 0)

### Question Cards
- **Queen (Q) & 8**  
  When played, the same player must immediately play an **Answer card**  
  (a non-power card of the same suit).

### Niko Kadi Rule
You **MUST** press the **"Niko Kadi"** warning button if you are left with:
- One card, or
- Multiple cards of the same rank  

Failure to do so results in a **+2 card penalty**.

### Cardless State
If you finish with a **Power Card**, you are **Cardless (0 cards)** but **haven't won yet**.  
You must pick on your next turn.
